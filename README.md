# RLS
### Rust Logic Simulator

Logisim-inspired logic circuits simulator

### Progress

- [x] Placing wires and builtin test circuit
- [x] State system, one circuit board can have multiple states
- [x] Selection
- [x] Deletion of wires and circuits
- [x] Probably another rewrite of internal wire data representation in editor
- [ ] Proper UI
- [ ] Circuit interactables 
> special circuit interfaces that can be exposed on containinc circuit design and can receive user input
- [ ] Proper UI
- [ ] Circuit list
- [ ] Place circuit boards as circuits
- [ ] Circuit designer for circuit boards
